**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the customer base of Zomato to identify key customer segments and their purchasing behavior. By leveraging data analysis techniques, the goal was to uncover trends and actionable insights into customer demographics, order frequency, and purchasing habits.

**Objectives**

To understand Zomato’s customer segments and purchasing patterns.

To analyze customer demographics and identify high-value segments for targeted marketing.

To develop visual insights to guide decision-making for enhancing customer engagement.

**Methodology**

Formulated research questions based on hypotheses like "Are younger customers more likely to order frequently?" and "Do higher-income customers place larger orders?"

Cleaned and transformed the data by handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating derived metrics for analysis.

Conducted segmentation analysis to categorize customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.

**Data Preparation**

**Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled systematically, and inconsistent data formats were standardized to ensure uniformity.

**Transformation**: Created derived metrics such as average order value per customer and frequency of purchases.

**Segmentation**: Used demographic information and purchasing patterns to identify high-value customer segments.

**Key Insights**

Younger customers (aged 18-35) showed a higher frequency of orders, aligning with the hypothesis of their higher engagement with food delivery services.

Higher-income customers consistently placed larger orders, contributing significantly to Zomato’s revenue.

Certain segments, like families and working professionals, demonstrated clear purchasing patterns based on time of day and order size.

**Visualizations**

Visualizations were created to represent the customer base clearly and concisely:

Pie charts for customer demographics, illustrating age group distributions.

Bar charts for comparing purchase frequency across different customer segments.

Line graphs to track order values over time.

Heatmaps for visualizing geographic concentrations of high-value customers.

**Conclusion and Further Improvements**

This analysis provided Zomato with a clearer understanding of its customer base and key segments, enabling data-driven decisions for marketing and customer engagement strategies. Future improvements could include:

Analyzing seasonal or promotional effects on customer behavior.

Expanding the dataset to include competitive analysis with other food delivery platforms.

Using machine learning techniques to predict future customer behavior and trends.
